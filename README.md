# Library Managment System

In this project, I propose a software for manageing libraries with multiple branches along with their books available to borrow by members. I built the basic APIs to manage the users including admins and members, books, authors, categories of books, branches details and the borrowing and returning operations.
All APIs were authorized by users roles through JWT Bearer Authentication schema.
