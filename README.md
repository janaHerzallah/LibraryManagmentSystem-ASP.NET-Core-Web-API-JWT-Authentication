# Library Managment System

In this project, I propose a software for manageing libraries with multiple branches along with their books available to borrow by members. I built the basic APIs to manage the users including admins and members, books, authors, categories of books, branches details and the borrowing and returning operations.
\n All APIs were authorized by users roles through JWT Bearer Authentication schema.
\n my APIs were directly connected to the library managemnet system on pgadmin.
\n starting off with the packages needed to configure my system:

\n my application can be tested through the swagger configuration since it shows the ADD, UPDATE , DELETE , SOFT-DELETE , GET-ACTIVE , GET-ALL ,GET - BY -ID for all tables and also BORROW A BOOK , RETURN A BOOK 
\n this was built on microsoft visual studio .NET version 8
